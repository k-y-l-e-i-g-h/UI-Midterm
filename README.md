This assignment is the midterm for my UI Design class â€“ it displays cumulative knowledge of the things learned in all the lectures in the first half of the semester.

The Catisfaction -- a website made for cat owners to peruse and learn about feline products. Of note the is the "Mimi's Review" subsection for each product, which unveils my cat's honest experience with the products, as well as listing cheaper, house hold items that could replace such overpriced, ridiculous cat products.

I had a lot of fun designing and building this project from scratch! I hope to iterate on the design as well as coninue to grow the database of feline products.
